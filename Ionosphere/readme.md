To initialize script please create venv with requirements.txt and run open jupyter notebook or python files for top500

Ionosphere notebooks was created with https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere
There we have different antenna readings with classification problem for good and bad - if there is any structure in

Top500 SVC and Decision Tree classifiers trying to classify and predict year of World super computers, measuring by
